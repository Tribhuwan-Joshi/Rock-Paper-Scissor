# Rock-Paper-Scissor
A simple Rock-Paper-Scissor game <br>

I created three function to simulate the game 

- computerPlay  
    - It will return a random choice 

- playRound 
    - It will simulate a single round and declare winner using conditionals 

- game  
    - It will call the playRound function 5 times and declare the game winner
